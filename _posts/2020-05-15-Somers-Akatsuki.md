[Akatsuki] was an IJN destroyer. She was of [Fubuki-class]. As a slightly upscaled version of original Fubuki, her torpedo launcher placements remained the same as of Fubuki, only upgraded to have turrets covering them. And those torpedo launchers each has 3 torpedo to launch in one run, and has three of them, so number of torpedo tubes sums up at 9. The later models of IJN DD like [Shiratsuyu] opted into a 2x4 scheme of torpedo tubes, effectively reducing the torpedo power by 1/9. But that might have improved the efficiency of their torpedo reloading mechanisms, though.

The somewhat most early shipgirl game, "Kantai Collection", had put an erratic illustration of Akatsuki. Though she never equipped any quadruple torpedo launcher, she was drawn to have them[^1]. The rest of the series, portrait of her younger sisters (Hibiki, Ikazuchi and Inazuma), by the same artist, had this corrected, though.

If she really had quads in place of triples, her armament layout will effectively be somewhat like USS [Somers-class]. The Somers-class destroyers (with AA modifications) had a same number: 2x3 main batteries, 3x4 torpedo launchers, bunch of anti-air. The Somers was built longer and displaces more, to actually handle the weight of more torpedo tubes (and a extra main turret when first built too!), though.

Interestingly, the [Hibiki] kai-2, or Верный, after received and modified by the USSR, was recorded to have 6 533mm Soviet torpedo tubes. The exact same error was introduced again: she had quad torpedo launchers in the illustration instead, and a total of 8 torpedo tubes. The illustration also seemed to be drawn by the same artist, in a series with her sister Akatsuki kai-2 (and Akatsuki's quads was downgraded to triples, though).

[^1]: Note that, a shipgirl having fewer turrets than history is common (and de-facto) though, e.g. Shimakaze-chan only have one quintuple torpedo launcher mounted on her back.
