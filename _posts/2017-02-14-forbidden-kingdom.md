Soon does darkness cover my world  
The hands reach nothing but a hoax  
I did yell, "Eli! Eli!", as none replied  
I might fell, into wherever deeper inside

Cannot find that key to my heart  
Likely those sweet petals are rotting away  
Is there redemption of mine, or not  
It's locked up forever, can't nothing do help

Please hold me tightly  
More, more tightly  
As night slips away  
Thus I'm not alone

Why had there been us  
Where would we go to  
When does it fall, the rain  
Who will unlock my heart
